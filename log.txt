Mood Map Development Log
------------------------

Set up documentation engine dartdoc.

    To run dartdoc just type dartdoc in the root of the project.

Found a really good resource for some basic ui tool building here:

      https://github.com/fablue/building-a-social-network-with-flutter

Built the default application view which I call the application shell.
It consists of a bottom navigation bar with the three views on it.

First I am going to start with the manage view because it will also lay the
foundation for the rating view. I hope to reuse the container of the list
view and just populate it with different list elements for each different
page.
