Mood Map Development Log
------------------------

Set up documentation engine dartdoc.

    To run dartdoc just type dartdoc in the root of the project.

Found a really good resource for some basic ui tool building here:

      https://github.com/fablue/building-a-social-network-with-flutter

Built the default application view which I call the application shell.
It consists of a bottom navigation bar with the three views on it.

First I am going to start with the manage view because it will also lay the
foundation for the rating view. I hope to reuse the container of the list
view and just populate it with different list elements for each different
page.

It seems that I will start building another stateful widget for each of the pages
and place them in the three areas of the scaffold in app_shell.dart.

It looks as if the PageView Widget takes containers as children. These containers
extend Widget. Thus I can continue implementing Stateful widgets as my children to
this page.

Starting to build the manage view dart file...

Found that the way to build a cross app bar is to use the Row widget and
expand a column within it.

         
It seems that I've done all that I can with the view of the manage Emotions view
without going into widget loading or databases so I will leave it off for now.

Now Im moving on to the Rating view. Luckily, it seems that much of the rating
view is the same as the manage view so I can take the bones out and move them
over.

Well that was easy.

Now it is time to think about notifications/prompting. I want to do it in a dialog
box but where do I put the button that brings it up on the rating page?

Looks like the flutter library has a charts api but if it doesnt work then I can
use 3rd party apis like the ones in the resources gitub I found

Finished the implementation of the dropdowns for the rating mechanism.
            
            -May want to switch to a slider for the mechanism later on

Instead of putting the prompting and notifications in the rating screen I think
it is better placed in the manage screen because that is what we are doing is
managing notifications.

         I've decided to use a tab bar to switch between adding and removing
         emotions and managing notifications

Finished the architecture for the management tab.

Now it is time to build the Reminders mangament tab
